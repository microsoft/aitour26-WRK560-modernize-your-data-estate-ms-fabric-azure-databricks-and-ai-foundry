# Exercise 2: Build DLT Pipelines and Mirror Azure Databricks Catalog

This exercise shows how Microsoft Fabric with Azure Databricks enabled Zava to solve their integration challenges. The acquired company, Litware Inc., was already using Databricks heavily and they stored their churn and sales data in ADLS Gen2. We’ll see how Unity Catalog benefited Zava's data architects so they could quickly get up to speed on all Litware Inc.’s data.

## Task 2.1: Create Delta Live Table pipeline for Data Transformation

Delta Live Tables (DLT) allow you to build and manage reliable data pipelines that deliver high-quality data in Lakehouse. DLT helps data engineering teams simplify ETL development and management with declarative pipeline development, automatic data testing, and deep visibility for monitoring and recovery.

1. Open a new tab in your VM browser and sign in to the Azure Databricks Workspace, by navigating to this url: `https://@lab.Variable(workspaceurl)`.

2. Click on the **Sign in with Microsoft Entra ID**.

3. On the left navigation pane, select **Jobs and pipelines**.

4. Select the **Create** dropdown and choose **ETL Pipeline**.

This beautiful lineage view showing the Medallion Architecture is a data design pattern commonly used in Databricks to organize and optimize data processing workflows in a lakehouse architecture. It structures data into three logical layers—Bronze, Silver, and Gold—ensuring data quality, accessibility, and scalability for analytics and machine learning.
