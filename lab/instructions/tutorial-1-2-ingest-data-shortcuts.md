## Task 1.2: Use the New Shortcut option from external data sources

Now, this is something exciting! This section shows how easy it is to create Shortcuts without moving data. That is the power of OneLake! In this exercise, you will ingest the curated bounce rate data for Litware from ADLS Gen2 using the New Shortcut option. Letâ€™s see how!

1. Inside the *ZavaLakehouse*, select the **three dots (ellipses)** on the right side of Files.

2. Select **New Shortcut**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Note:** Make sure you create a shortcut under **Files** and not under **tables** in the lakehouse explorer pane.

Prior to Microsoft Fabric, departments at Zava had to move the data they needed from other departments via time-consuming ETL processes. But look, now they have created shortcuts. No need to move any of this data. That is the power of OneLake!
